# 2D Complementary Attitude Filter Simulation

This implements a 2D complementary attitude filter for the purposes of analyzing how accelerometer and gyroscope noise affects attitude estimate accuracy.

Supports

* Gaussian accelerometer noise
* Gaussian gyroscope noise
* Brownian motion gyroscope bias drift
